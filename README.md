# laser_ABCD
Laser Beam propagation with ABCD matrices employing beam parameter and M^2


Beam Propagation is the main programm and this is the only one that needs to be run


ABCD_utensils contains all functions to compute the beam radius.

The Input files Input_param.txt and Lenses_param.txt are the ones that need to be changed to customize the beam.

Input_param.txt contains the measured beam profile parameter like MÂ², w_0,...
For the lasers tested during this study the parameters are summarized below (note that the divergence needs to converted to radians):

To include lenses in the beam path, have a look at the Lenses_param.txt file. Here, you can add lenses according to position and focal length.
All distances are in mm.
